# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

# Created simple calander to schedule workday flow

# Utilized 3rd party API's for formatting and design

# Written with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascrip and jQuery

# When user enters task to be scheduled in time slot, page saves to local storage

# When user deltes, item is removed

# When time slot is approaching, calander changes color; red if it's past, yellow when approaching, green when in the future.
